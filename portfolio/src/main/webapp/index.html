            My full name is Thomas Joaquin Kaufman-Gomez, but I usually just go by Tommy Gomez. I'm a rising junior at Columbia University
            in New York City, and I'm studying computer science. Born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, I've lived on both coasts and
            can confidently confirm that the West Coast is superior, although the East Coast is not to be undervalued (in fact, I 
            would argue that both coasts are equal if it weren't for the East's weather).
        </p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I've developed strong, unpredictable, and often unusual passions (check out the Interests tab
            for specifics). These passions are sort of like intellectual rabbit holes, because I dedicate most of my time to learning as
            much about them as I can. This made declaring a major difficult, as I was stuck in multiple rabbit holes and had to focus on
            one. I found that computer science was like the ultimate rabbit hole; it's a subject so versatile that it has applications
            in every field imaginable. To me, computer science is the culmination of my passions, because it gives me the limitless ability
            to build, model, and analyze anything that interests me. There's nothing I'd rather do for the rest of my life.</p>

        <h3>Early childhood</h3>
        <img src="/images/jupiter.png" alt="Astronomy" style="width: 40%; border-radius: 50%;">
        <p>The first thing I  remember being interested in is astronomy. Before I could read, I would look at pictures of planets, stars, and galaxies, amazed by
            their shiny rings, bright colors, and swirling patterns. Once I was a little older, the facts I learned about astronomy shocked me. I couldn't believe
            that a day on Venus is longer than a year (that one still baffles me), or that the hottest stars burn blue. What I found most appealing about astronomy,
            however, was how little we know. To this day, I wonder about how the universe began, what storms are like on other planets, what happens when galaxies
            collide, and of course whether or not aliens exist (I think they do ðŸ‘½). There's so much to learn about the universe, which is 
            why this interest has never quite left me.

        <p>In the summer after third grade, I went on a road trip to Yellowstone National Park. With nothing better to do during the drive, I paid close attention to the 
            various highways we took and the destinations they led to. After seeing roads that led to Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver, and other cities, I became interested
            in the geographical layout of roads. Not only was I curious about where each road went, but I wanted to see what the drive looked like. Google Maps became
            one of my favorite websites. Not only did it allow me to see how roads connect to bring you to your destination, but I could use street view to see
            what the drive there would look like. Ever since then, I've always looked forward to exploring places I've never been. In fact, my favorite pastime during
            the pandemic has been driving around aimlessly, taking roads I've never been on.

        <h2>Tornadoes</h2>
        <h3>Middle school</h3>
        <img src="/images/tornado.jpg" alt="Tornadoes" style="width: 80%">
        <p>Throughout all of middle school and a decent part of high school, I was set on going to the University of Oklahoma and becoming a meteorologist and storm chaser.
            While this is no longer my dream job, I still very much plan on seeing a tornado some day. After watching <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i> in 6th grade, I was
            fascinated by the scene in which multiple tornadoes devastate Los Angeles. Living in the Bay Area, which is known for its beautiful (or boring, as I like to 
            think of it) weather, seeing such powerful meteorological phenomena amazed me. I spent much of my time researching everything I could about tornadoes, 
            and spent hours watching videos made by storm chasers. Amazed by both their ferocity and their beauty, tornadoes were my greatest passion for many years.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Early high school</h3>
        <img src="/images/salesforce-tower.jpg" alt="Architecture" style="width: 30%">
        <p>I knew I had a passion for architecture the first time I stepped foot in New York City. Coming from a very suburban area, I had never experienced urbanism like
            it is in New York. I remember thinking to myself, "<i>Everything</i> here is a skyscraper," and I quickly found a deep interest in the world's tallest
            buildings. Frequently visiting the Wikipedia pages for the tallest buildings in various cities, I was intrigued by the unique design of skyscrapers
            everywhere, because their sheer size makes them attention-grabbing symbols of the cities they stand in, and their prominence permanently shapes a city's
            skyline. I find myself reading blogs from sites like <a href="https://newyorkyimby.com/">New York Yimby</a> to see what new skyscrapers are being built today,
            and I can't wait to see how future skyscrapers shape the skylines of cities across the world.

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <h3>Late high school</h2>
        <img src="/images/nyc.jpg" alt="Photography" style="width: 80%">
        <p>My interest in photography goes hand-in-hand with my interest in architecture. I was already taking thousands of pictures of skyscrapers on my phone, but I
            couldn't zoom in far enough to see buildings' intricate details without sacrificing the quality of the photo. Getting a camera solved this problem, and also
            gave me a new passion. I started out by taking pictures of the buildings I admired, but I also began experimenting with broader scenery, time lapses, and
            portrait photography. Photography was frustrating, especially because I was a beginner and didn't know how to use my camera well, but my frustration was
            part of what made photography interesting to me. It motivated me to explore my camera's settings until I learned how to take photos I really liked, two of
            which are the photo of 7th Avenue above and the background photo of this webpage.

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <h3>College - present</h3>
        <img src="/images/comp-sci.jpg" alt="Computer Science" style="width: 70%">
        <p>In 7th grade, I was introduced to computer science on Khan Academy, where I took beginner JavaScript courses. Although I thought JavaScript was cool and I 
            took some Java classes in high school, computer science didn't really become a passion of mine until recently, in my first semester of college. I signed
            up for a course called "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Java", which turned out to be far from an introduction. The class was super technical,
            fast-paced, and had monstrous assignments that resulted in multiple all-nighters. I expected to hate it, but surprisingly, I didn't. I was genuinely interested
            in what I was learning, and I didn't even mind the debugging at 4 am. In all of my prior academic career, there had never been a class or subject that I
            enjoyed putting so much effort into. As I took more computer science classes, my interest grew, and it became clear what my major was going to be. To this day,
            computer science remains my strongest interest, and I'm overjoyed to be able to pursue the subject I'm most passionate about.
