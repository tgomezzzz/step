			<h3>About Me</h3>

                My full name is Thomas Joaquin Kaufman-Gomez, but I usually just go by Tommy Gomez. I'm a rising junior at Columbia University
                in New York City, and I'm studying computer science. Born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, I've lived on both coasts and
                can confidently confirm that the West Coast is superior, although the East Coast is not to be undervalued (in fact, I 
                would argue that both coasts are equal if it weren't for the East's weather).</p>
            
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've developed strong, unpredictable, and often unusual passions (check out the Interests tab
                for specifics). These passions are sort of like intellectual rabbit holes, because I dedicate most of my time to learning as
                much about them as I can. This made declaring a major difficult, as I was stuck in multiple rabbit holes and had to focus on
                one. I found that computer science was like the ultimate rabbit hole; it's a subject so versatile that it has applications
                in every field imaginable. To me, computer science is the culmination of my passions, because it gives me the limitless ability
                to build, model, and analyze anything that interests me. There's nothing I'd rather do for the rest of my life.</p>
